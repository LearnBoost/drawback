Drawback
========

The Drawback framework provides a seamless way to render 2D drawings on 
the client side using HTML5 technologies with a server-side backend.

## Defining the drawings

Every drawing (eg: a chart) logic goes into a separate file that provides both
CommonJS and browser compliance as follows:

    (function(){
      var module = module || {};

      module.exports = function(data, element){
        // element is the element that the <canvas> will be injected to.
        // for example, if leveraging jQuery flot, that means it will be called as:

        $.plot(element, { ..., data: data });
      };

      module.exports.flot = true;

      if (typeof window != 'undefined' && 'Drawback' in window)
        Drawback.register('my_example', module.exports);

    })();

In this case, the file would be stored in `public/js/draw/my_example.js`.
Notice that the filename has to match the `register` first parameter.

Notice that we're also adding the `flot` option to module.exports. This is needed
for the server side rendering to load the appropriate module for rendering.

## Drawing (client side)

In order to effectively draw a chart, first it needs to be included in the \<head\>,
so that it's compiled along with the rest of the public JavaScript:

    script(src: '/js/draw/my_example.js')

Then, in the specific section JavaScript, once the DOM is loaded we can draw it
like this:

    jQuery(function($){
      Drawback.draw('#some_element', 'my_example', '/data/url', options);
    });

Notice that we're passing the selector as first parameter, the draw id as the second
 and options as the fourth.

### Drawback#draw

The `Drawback.draw` method is in charge of deciding the rendering method (server
or browser) and behaving accordingly.

#### Browser rendering
  
For browser rendering, the draw method simply looks up the registered functions 
(through `register` calls), and calls it passing the data retrieves from the
data url.

While the data is being retrieved, a class `loading` is added to the target element.

#### Server fallback

For server rendering, an url is constructed as follows:

    /draw/my_example?url={data url}

An `Image` element is created and the `src` attribute is set. A class `loading` is
added to the target element, and it's removed when the `onload` event fires for the
image, and the image is injected.

Server fallback is used whenever feature testing for `<canvas>` presence fails.

#### Options

The last parameter of the `draw` function call is an object of options.

- sync

  If set to true, when browser rendering is performed, the data is fetched through
  a synchronous ajax request. Defaults to false

- download

  Whether to include a download button along with the <canvas>. If set to true,
  it injects an element like this _before_ the target element.

      <a href="/draw/my_example?url={data url}&download=1">Download</a>

- forceServer

  If set to true it ignores browser rendering and always does server side rendering.

- urlBuilder

  A function that constructs the url for server fallback. It gets the drawing name
  and data url as parameters. There's also a third argument called `forceDownload`,
  which is set to true for the download link construction.
  
  It defaults to a function that returns the format specified above.

## Server side component

### Public API

The node.js module is a simple function call that receives the `module.exports` (ie:
the `require()` module) and returns a node-canvas rendered buffer.

    var drawback = require('drawback');

    drawback.draw(module, data, function(err, buffer){
      // 
    });

### Plugins support

Plugins are included like

    drawback.use(require('path/to/plugin')())

And plugin source follows the connect middleware style:

    module.export = function pluginName(){
      return function(){

      };
    };

The `flot` plugin is built-in, and it's exported, so it can be accessed like this:

    drawback.use(drawback.plugins.flot);

The purpose of the flot plugin is to include a dummy jQuery, include the flot source
modified/overriden for node-canvas compatibility.
